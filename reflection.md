- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
    Inheritance can vastly improve your speed, but only if you don't have to undo some qualities of the top level. If you just want to add capability, then it seems very efficient.
    I also end up focusing more on what makes the class unique, rather than worrying about the similarities between classes as I'm coding, since inheritance takes care of all the similarities with one easy line "___ extends ___" and super(___). It makes my code tidier as well.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
    I realized that I had the wrong idea about ".this". The command ".this" reaches out to the top level, not the nearest instance. I also realized that I've become more comfortable with finding the right methods I need, and the building blocks of classes, methods, and parameters have started to come more naturally to me rather than having to always go back to my notes to see what comes next. In addition, I've started really utilizing the main method of each class for debugging.
